My tiny and simple, multilanguage by default, framework (or presets) which inspired by Symfony. I create and support it in education and presentation purposes. Write own small "pet" projects with it. 

Current version - alpha.1.0

## Installation

- Download/get "main" branch into dir
- Remove .git directory if you plan setup own git project (optional)

## Library architecture

## Routing

## Database connection

## Controllers

## View

## Models

## Helper files

Files for help to setup project in different stack, ex. docker directory with ready docker-default images for default preset.


### Feature in near future
- register it as package, add composer instalation support
- rewrite render component
- add dependency injection support
- add cli commands support
- create site with detail documentation
